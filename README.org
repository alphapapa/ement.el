The default formatting style resembles IRC clients, with each message being prefixed by the username (which enables powerful Emacs features, like using Occur to show all messages from or mentioning a user).  Alternative, built-in styles include an Element-like one with usernames above groups of messages, as well as a classic, no-margins IRC style.  Messages may be optionally displayed with unique colors for each user (with customizeable contrast), making it easier to follow conversations.  Timestamp headers are optionally displayed where a certain amount of time passes between events, as well as where the date changes.

:TOC:      :depth 0
:END:

# ** MELPA
# 
# If you installed from MELPA, you're done.  Just run one of the commands below.

** Quelpa

The recommended way to install is with [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package][quelpa-use-package]], like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  ;; Install and load `quelpa-use-package'.
  (package-install 'quelpa-use-package)
  (require 'quelpa-use-package)

  ;; Install `plz' HTTP library (not on MELPA yet).
  (use-package plz
    :quelpa (plz :fetcher github :repo "alphapapa/plz.el"))

  ;; Install Ement.
  (use-package ement
    :quelpa (ement :fetcher github :repo "alphapapa/ement.el"))
#+END_SRC

** Manual

If you want to install it manually, it's simple enough, but you should know what you're doing, and you're on your own.

1.  Call command ~ement-connect~ to connect.  Multiple sessions are supported, so you may call the command again to connect to another account.
2.  Wait for initial sync to complete (which can take a few moments--initial sync JSON requests can be large).
3.  Use these commands:
      -  ~ement-list-rooms~ to view the list of joined rooms.
      -  ~ement-view-room~ to view a room's buffer, selected with completion.
      -  ~ement-create-room~ to create a new room.
      -  ~ement-invite~ to invite a user to a room.
      -  ~ement-join-room~ to join a room.
      -  ~ement-leave-room~ to leave a room.
      -  ~ement-forget-room~ to forget a room.
      -  ~ement-tag-room~ to add (or with interactive prefix, remove) a tag on a room (including favorite/low-priority status).
      -  ~ement-send-direct-message~ to send a direct message to a user (in an existing direct room, or creating a new one automatically).
      -  ~ement-room-edit-message~ to edit a message at point.
      -  ~ement-room-send-file~ to send a file.
      -  ~ement-room-send-image~ to send an image.
      -  ~ement-room-set-topic~ to set a room's topic.
      -  ~ement-room-occur~ to search in a room's known events.
      -  ~ement-ignore-user~ to ignore a user (or with interactive prefix, un-ignore).
      -  ~ement-room-set-message-format~ to set a room's message format buffer-locally.
4.  Use these special buffers to see events from multiple rooms (you can also reply to messages from these buffers!):
      -  See all new events that mention you in the =*Ement Mentions*= buffer.
      -  See all new events in rooms that have open buffers in the =*Ement Notifications*= buffer.

** Bindings

These bindings are common to all of the following buffer types:

+  Switch to the room list buffer: ~M-g M-l~
+  Switch to the mentions buffer: ~M-g M-m~
+  Switch to the notifications buffer: ~M-g M-n~

*** Room buffers

+  Show command menu: ~?~

*Sending messages*

+  Write new message: ~RET~
+  Write reply to event at point (when region is active, only quote marked text) : ~S-RET~
+  Complete members and rooms at point: ~C-M-i~ (standard ~completion-at-point~ command).
+  Compose message in a separate buffer (while writing in minibuffer): ~C-c '~ (Use command ~ement-room-compose-org~ to activate Org mode in the compose buffer.)
+  Send emote: ~e~
+  Send reaction (a type of annotation) to event at point, or send same reaction at point: ~a~
+  Delete message at point: ~C-k~

*Viewing rooms*

+  Move between events: ~TAB~ / ~<backtab>~
+  Scroll down (at the end of a room buffer, mark it as read and bury it): ~SPC~
+  Scroll up: ~S-SPC~
+  Move to the fully-read marker: ~M-SPC~
+  Load older messages: at top of buffer, scroll up (i.e. ~S-SPC~, ~M-v~ or ~mwheel-scroll~)
+  Search messages (~occur~-style): ~o~
+  Show source of event at point: ~v~
+  Show another room: ~r~
+  Show room list buffer: ~R~
+  Sync new messages (not necessary if auto sync is enabled; with prefix to force new sync): ~g~

*Viewing images*

+  Toggle scale of image at point (between fit-to-window and thumbnail): ~mouse-1~
+  Show image in new buffer at full size: ~double-mouse-1~

*** Room list buffer

+  Show buffer of room at point: ~RET~
+  Show buffer of next unread room: ~SPC~
+  Move between room names: ~TAB~ / ~<backtab>~

*** Mentions/notifications buffers

+  Move between events: ~TAB~ / ~<backtab>~
+  Go to event at point in its room buffer: ~RET~
+  Write reply to event at point (shows the event in its room while writing) : ~S-RET~

** Tips

# TODO: Show sending messages in Org format.

+  Desktop notifications are enabled by default for events that mention the local user.  They can also be shown for all events in rooms with open buffers.
+  Send messages in Org mode format by customizing the option ~ement-room-send-message-filter~ (which enables Org format by default), or by calling ~ement-room-compose-org~ in a compose buffer (which enables it for a single message).  Then Org-formatted messages are automatically converted and sent as HTML-formatted messages (with the Org syntax as the plain-text fallback).  You can send syntax such as:
     -  Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough
     -  Links
     -  Tables
     -  Source blocks (including results with ~:exports both~)
     -  Footnotes (okay, that might be pushing it, but you can!)
     -  And, generally, anything that Org can export to HTML
+  Starting in the room list buffer, by pressing ~SPC~ repeatedly, you can cycle through and read all rooms with unread buffers.  (If a room doesn't have a buffer, it will not be included.)
+  Room buffers and the room-list buffer can be bookmarked in Emacs, i.e. using =C-x r m=.  This is especially useful with [[https://github.com/alphapapa/burly.el][Burly]]: you can arrange an Emacs frame with several room buffers displayed at once, use =burly-bookmark-windows= to bookmark the layout, and then you can restore that layout and all of the room buffers by opening the bookmark, rather than having to manually arrange them every time you start Emacs or change the window configuration.
+  You can customize settings in the ~ement~ group.
     -  *Note:* ~setq~ should not be used for certain options, because it will not call the associated setter function.  Users who have an aversion to the customization system may experience problems.

*** Displaying symbols and emojis

Emacs may not display certain symbols and emojis well by default.  Based on [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/62049/override-the-default-font-for-emoji-characters][this question and answer]], you may find that the simplest way to fix this is to install an appropriate font, like [[https://www.google.com/get/noto/#emoji-zsye][Noto Emoji]], and then use this Elisp code:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setf use-default-font-for-symbols nil)
  (set-fontset-font t 'unicode "Noto Emoji" nil 'append)
#+END_SRC

** Encrypted room support through Pantalaimon

Ement.el doesn't support encrypted rooms natively, but it can be used transparently with the E2EE-aware reverse proxy daemon [[https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon/][Pantalaimon]].  After configuring it according to its documentation, call ~ement-connect~ with the appropriate hostname and port, like:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (ement-connect :uri-prefix "http://localhost:8009")
#+END_SRC

* Rationale

Why write a new Emacs Matrix client when there is already [[https://github.com/alphapapa/matrix-client.el][matrix-client.el]], by the same author, no less?  A few reasons:

-  ~matrix-client~ uses an older version of the Matrix spec, r0.3.0, with a few elements of r0.4.0 grafted in.  Bringing it up to date with the current version of the spec, r0.6.1, would be more work than to begin with the current version.  Ement.el targets r0.6.1 from the beginning.
-  ~matrix-client~ does not use Matrix's lazy-loading feature (which was added to the specification later), so initial sync requests can take a long time for the server to process and can be large (sometimes tens of megabytes of JSON for the client to process!).  Ement.el uses lazy-loading, which significantly improves performance.
-  ~matrix-client~ automatically makes buffers for every room a user has joined, even if the user doesn't currently want to watch a room.  Ement.el opens room buffers on-demand, improving performance by not having to insert events into buffers for rooms the user isn't watching.
-  ~matrix-client~ was developed without the intention of publishing it to, e.g. MELPA or ELPA.  It has several dependencies, and its code does not always install or compile cleanly due to macro-expansion issues (apparently depending on the user's Emacs config).  Ement.el is designed to have minimal dependencies outside of Emacs (currently only one, ~plz~, which could be imported into the project), and every file is linted and compiles cleanly using [[https://github.com/alphapapa/makem.sh][makem.sh]].
-  ~matrix-client~ uses EIEIO, probably unnecessarily, since few, if any, of the benefits of EIEIO are realized in it.  Ement.el uses structs instead.
-  ~matrix-client~ uses bespoke code for inserting messages into buffers, which works pretty well, but has a few minor bugs which are difficult to track down.  Ement.el uses Emacs's built-in (and perhaps little-known) ~ewoc~ library, which makes it much simpler and more reliable to insert and update messages in buffers, and enables the development of advanced UI features more easily.
-  ~matrix-client~ was, to a certain extent, designed to imitate other messaging apps.  The result is, at least when used with the ~matrix-client-frame~ command, fairly pleasing to use, but isn't especially "Emacsy."  Ement.el is intended to better fit into Emacs's paradigms.
-  ~matrix-client~'s long name makes for long symbol names, which makes for tedious, verbose code.  ~ement~ is easy to type and makes for concise, readable code.
-  The author has learned much since writing ~matrix-client~ and hopes to write simpler, more readable, more maintainable code in Ement.el.  It's hoped that this will enable others to contribute more easily.

However, note that ~matrix-client~ is a more mature client and is very reliable in the author's experience.  While Ement.el is intended to reach feature parity with it and eventually surpass it, that will take some time, so ~matrix-client~ remains a good choice.

Bug reports, feature requests, suggestions — /oh my/!

** Debugging / Troubleshooting

- It's recommended to set the variable ~print-circle~ to ~t~ in your Emacs config.  Ement.el uses circular data structures for some things, and these can cause Emacs to infinitely loop and/or allocate a large amount of memory when attemping to print a backtrace for an error (as well as when doing certain other things, like calling =C-u C-x == on text that has circular structures in its display properties).  Setting this variable to non-nil prevents that behavior and allows Emacs to quickly print these structures.

** Copyright Assignment

While Ement.el is not yet available in GNU ELPA and is not part of Emacs, it would be good to keep that option available.  In that case, cumulative contributions of more than 15 lines of code would require that the author assign copyright of such contributions to the FSF.  Therefore, please note that this project may require such assignment before accepting contributions.  Authors who are interested in doing so may contact [[mailto:assign@gnu.org][assign@gnu.org]] to request the appropriate form.
