The default formatting style resembles IRC clients, with each message being prefixed by the username (which enables powerful Emacs features, like using Occur to show all messages from or mentioning a user).  Alternative, built-in styles include an Element-like one with usernames above groups of messages, as well as a classic, no-margins IRC style.  Messages may be optionally displayed with unique colors for each user (with customizeable contrast), making it easier to follow conversations.  Timestamp headers are optionally displayed where a certain amount of time passes between events, as well as where the date changes.

* Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      :depth 0
:END:

** GNU ELPA

Ement.el is published in [[http://elpa.gnu.org/][GNU ELPA]], so it may be installed in Emacs with the command ~M-x package-install RET ement RET~.  This is the recommended way to install Ement.el, as it will install the current stable release.

** GNU Guix

Ement.el is also available in [[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix]] as ~emacs-ement~.

** Debian

Ement.el is also available in Debian as [[https://packages.debian.org/elpa-ement][elpa-ement]].

** Git master

The ~master~ branch of the Git repository is intended to be usable at all times; only minor bugs are expected to be found in it before a new stable release is made.  To install from this, it is recommended to use [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package][quelpa-use-package]], like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  ;; Install and load `quelpa-use-package'.
  (package-install 'quelpa-use-package)
  (require 'quelpa-use-package)

  ;; Install Ement.
  (use-package ement
    :quelpa (ement :fetcher github :repo "alphapapa/ement.el"))
#+END_SRC

One might also use systems like [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][Straight]] (which is also used by [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][DOOM]]) to install from Git, but the author cannot offer support for them.

** Manual

Ement.el is intended to be installed with Emacs's package system, which will ensure that the required autoloads are generated, etc.  If you choose to install it manually, you're on your own.

1.  Call command ~ement-connect~ to connect.  Multiple sessions are supported, so you may call the command again to connect to another account.
2.  Wait for initial sync to complete (which can take a few moments--initial sync JSON requests can be large).
3.  Use these commands:
      -  ~ement-list-rooms~ to view the list of joined rooms.
      -  ~ement-view-room~ to view a room's buffer, selected with completion.
      -  ~ement-create-room~ to create a new room.
      -  ~ement-invite-user~ to invite a user to a room.
      -  ~ement-join-room~ to join a room.
      -  ~ement-leave-room~ to leave a room.
      -  ~ement-forget-room~ to forget a room.
      -  ~ement-tag-room~ to add (or with interactive prefix, remove) a tag on a room (including favorite/low-priority status).
      -  ~ement-list-members~ to list members in a room.
      -  ~ement-send-direct-message~ to send a direct message to a user (in an existing direct room, or creating a new one automatically).
      -  ~ement-room-edit-message~ to edit a message at point.
      -  ~ement-room-send-file~ to send a file.
      -  ~ement-room-send-image~ to send an image.
      -  ~ement-room-set-topic~ to set a room's topic.
      -  ~ement-room-occur~ to search in a room's known events.
      -  ~ement-ignore-user~ to ignore a user (or with interactive prefix, un-ignore).
      -  ~ement-room-set-message-format~ to set a room's message format buffer-locally.
4.  Use these special buffers to see events from multiple rooms (you can also reply to messages from these buffers!):
      -  See all new events that mention you in the =*Ement Mentions*= buffer.
      -  See all new events in rooms that have open buffers in the =*Ement Notifications*= buffer.

** Bindings

These bindings are common to all of the following buffer types:

+  Switch to a room buffer: ~M-g M-r~

** Tips

# TODO: Show sending messages in Org format.

+  Desktop notifications are enabled by default for events that mention the local user.  They can also be shown for all events in rooms with open buffers.
+  Send messages in Org mode format by customizing the option ~ement-room-send-message-filter~ (which enables Org format by default), or by calling ~ement-room-compose-org~ in a compose buffer (which enables it for a single message).  Then Org-formatted messages are automatically converted and sent as HTML-formatted messages (with the Org syntax as the plain-text fallback).  You can send syntax such as:
     -  Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough
     -  Links
     -  Tables
     -  Source blocks (including results with ~:exports both~)
     -  Footnotes (okay, that might be pushing it, but you can!)
     -  And, generally, anything that Org can export to HTML
+  Starting in the room list buffer, by pressing ~SPC~ repeatedly, you can cycle through and read all rooms with unread buffers.  (If a room doesn't have a buffer, it will not be included.)
+  Room buffers and the room-list buffer can be bookmarked in Emacs, i.e. using =C-x r m=.  This is especially useful with [[https://github.com/alphapapa/burly.el][Burly]]: you can arrange an Emacs frame with several room buffers displayed at once, use =burly-bookmark-windows= to bookmark the layout, and then you can restore that layout and all of the room buffers by opening the bookmark, rather than having to manually arrange them every time you start Emacs or change the window configuration.
+  Images and other files can be uploaded to rooms using drag-and-drop.
+  You can customize settings in the ~ement~ group.
     -  *Note:* ~setq~ should not be used for certain options, because it will not call the associated setter function.  Users who have an aversion to the customization system may experience problems.

*** Displaying symbols and emojis

Emacs may not display certain symbols and emojis well by default.  Based on [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/62049/override-the-default-font-for-emoji-characters][this question and answer]], you may find that the simplest way to fix this is to install an appropriate font, like [[https://www.google.com/get/noto/#emoji-zsye][Noto Emoji]], and then use this Elisp code:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setf use-default-font-for-symbols nil)
  (set-fontset-font t 'unicode "Noto Emoji" nil 'append)
#+END_SRC

** Encrypted room support through Pantalaimon

Ement.el doesn't support encrypted rooms natively, but it can be used transparently with the E2EE-aware reverse proxy daemon [[https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon/][Pantalaimon]].  After configuring it according to its documentation, call ~ement-connect~ with the appropriate hostname and port, like:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (ement-connect :uri-prefix "http://localhost:8009")
#+END_SRC

* Rationale

Why write a new Emacs Matrix client when there is already [[https://github.com/alphapapa/matrix-client.el][matrix-client.el]], by the same author, no less?  A few reasons:

-  ~matrix-client~ uses an older version of the Matrix spec, r0.3.0, with a few elements of r0.4.0 grafted in.  Bringing it up to date with the current version of the spec, r0.6.1, would be more work than to begin with the current version.  Ement.el targets r0.6.1 from the beginning.
-  ~matrix-client~ does not use Matrix's lazy-loading feature (which was added to the specification later), so initial sync requests can take a long time for the server to process and can be large (sometimes tens of megabytes of JSON for the client to process!).  Ement.el uses lazy-loading, which significantly improves performance.
-  ~matrix-client~ automatically makes buffers for every room a user has joined, even if the user doesn't currently want to watch a room.  Ement.el opens room buffers on-demand, improving performance by not having to insert events into buffers for rooms the user isn't watching.
-  ~matrix-client~ was developed without the intention of publishing it to, e.g. MELPA or ELPA.  It has several dependencies, and its code does not always install or compile cleanly due to macro-expansion issues (apparently depending on the user's Emacs config).  Ement.el is designed to have minimal dependencies outside of Emacs (currently only one, ~plz~, which could be imported into the project), and every file is linted and compiles cleanly using [[https://github.com/alphapapa/makem.sh][makem.sh]].
-  ~matrix-client~ uses EIEIO, probably unnecessarily, since few, if any, of the benefits of EIEIO are realized in it.  Ement.el uses structs instead.
-  ~matrix-client~ uses bespoke code for inserting messages into buffers, which works pretty well, but has a few minor bugs which are difficult to track down.  Ement.el uses Emacs's built-in (and perhaps little-known) ~ewoc~ library, which makes it much simpler and more reliable to insert and update messages in buffers, and enables the development of advanced UI features more easily.
-  ~matrix-client~ was, to a certain extent, designed to imitate other messaging apps.  The result is, at least when used with the ~matrix-client-frame~ command, fairly pleasing to use, but isn't especially "Emacsy."  Ement.el is intended to better fit into Emacs's paradigms.
-  ~matrix-client~'s long name makes for long symbol names, which makes for tedious, verbose code.  ~ement~ is easy to type and makes for concise, readable code.
-  The author has learned much since writing ~matrix-client~ and hopes to write simpler, more readable, more maintainable code in Ement.el.  It's hoped that this will enable others to contribute more easily.

Note that, while ~matrix-client~ remains usable, and probably will for some time to come, Ement.el has now surpassed it in every way.  The only reason to choose ~matrix-client~ instead is if one is using an older version of Emacs that isn't supported by Ement.el.

* Changelog
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      :depth 0
:END:

** 0.2-pre

*Changes*
+ Read receipts are re-enabled.  (They're now implemented with a global idle timer rather than ~window-scroll-functions~, which sometimes caused a strange race condition that could cause Emacs to become unresponsive or crash.)
+ When determining whether a room is considered unread, non-message events like membership changes, reactions, etc. are ignored.  This fixes a bug that caused certain rooms that had no message events (like some bridged rooms) to appear as unread when they shouldn't have.  But it's unclear whether this is always preferable (e.g. one might want a member leaving a room to cause it to be marked unread), so this is classified as a change rather than simply a fix, and more improvements may be made to this in the future.  (Fixes [[https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/97][#97]].  Thanks to [[https://github.com/MrRoy][Julien Roy]] for reporting and testing.)
+ The ~ement-taxy-room-list~ view no longer automatically refreshes the list if the region is active in the buffer.  (This allows the user to operate on multiple rooms without the contents of the buffer changing before completing the process.)

*Fixes*
+ Links to only rooms (as opposed to links to events in rooms) may be activated to join them.
+ Read receipts mark the last completely visible event (rather than one that's only partially displayed).

** 0.1.4

*Fixed*
+ Info manual directory headers.

** 0.1.3

*Fixed*
# + Read receipt-sending function was called too many times when scrolling.
# + Send read receipts even when the last receipt is outside the range of retrieved events.
+ Temporarily disable sending of read receipts due to an unusual bug that could cause Emacs to become unresponsive.  (The feature will be re-enabled in a future release.)

** 0.1.2

*Fixed*
+ Function ~ement-room-sync~ correctly updates room-list buffers.  (Thanks to [[https://github.com/vizs][Visuwesh]].)
+ Only send D-Bus notifications when supported.  (Fixes [[https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/83][#83]].  Thanks to [[https://github.com/tsdh][Tassilo Horn]].)

** 0.1.1

*Fixed*
+ Function ~ement-room-scroll-up-mark-read~ selects the correct room window.
+ Option ~ement-room-list-avatars~ defaults to what function ~display-images-p~ returns.

** 0.1

After almost two years of development, the first tagged release.  Submitted to GNU ELPA.
