** TODO Fix/rewrite read receipts
:LOGBOOK:
- State "TODO"       from              [2022-09-15 Thu 13:06]
:END:

To fix/rewrite read receipt sending, we'll need to make sure that a room can only have one outstanding read-receipt update request, and that an update request for the same position can't be repeated successively.  So:

1. [ ] Add a buffer-local room variable, an alist (of one entry) mapping an event ID to the plz request setting the read receipt to after that event.  ~ement-room-read-receipt-requests~
2. [ ] The read-receipt-updating function should compare the event ID to the one in that variable: if they match, do nothing; if they're different, cancel any outstanding request and send a new one, and set the variable accordingly.
3. [ ] In addition to using ~window-scroll-functions~ (which I hope we can get away with, after these other changes), we'll use ~window-selection-change-functions~ to also update the read receipt, similarly to Element (i.e. clicking in a room window should update the receipt with an idle timer).

** TODO Make bookmark handler put point at end of room buffers

When restoring a room buffer bookmark, having point at the top of the buffer isn't very useful, because I almost always want it to be at the bottom so I can follow new messages.

[2022-09-01 Thu 04:04]  Or maybe go to the fully-read marker instead.

** TODO Membership events in which nothing seems to change              :bug:

e.g. this one from an event in =#matrix:matrix.org= formats as "Unrecognized", because nothing is changed, so I don't even know what this event is supposed to mean.

These could be alternatives to using margins.  See [[info:elisp#Truncation][info:elisp#Truncation]].

** MAYBE Use =persist.el= for saving session data

It's in ELPA, and its code looks good.  Is there any reason not to use it?

** PROJECT Backfilling paged events after interrupted sync

e.g. when a system has been asleep for hours and syncs again, there may be more new events in a room than the server is willing to send in a single sync response, causing the response to be paged.  The old events need to be fetched in pages up to the old sync token.

+ [[file:worktrees/spec/matrix-spec-r0.6.1.org::*\[\[#id256\]\[9.4   Syncing\]\]][SPEC: 9.4 Syncing]]

This note from the spec is important:

#+begin_quote
Events are ordered in this API according to the arrival time of the event on the homeserver. This can conflict with other APIs which order events based on their partial ordering in the event graph. This can result in duplicate events being received (once per distinct API called). Clients SHOULD de-duplicate events based on the event ID when this happens.
#+end_quote

[2021-09-24 Fri]  This is done (in =6d772ec=) to a useful extent: after an interrupted sync, rooms are backfilled up to 1,000 events (and that number could be configurable).  Beyond that, a gap would remain, and it would remain unfilled within that Ement session.  (Disconnecting and reconnecting would cause the room history to be cleared and re-fetched from scratch.)

In the long run, a more flexible solution is needed, e.g. something like Element does, where it seems that an event can be fetched, displayed, and then gaps on either side of it are filled on-demand.  Doing that in Emacs with EWOC will probably require some thoughtful design.

:PROPERTIES:

:END:

Not sure how this is intended to work, e.g. in Element sometimes rooms seem to show a preview in direct rooms, so you can see what someone said before you accept the invitation to the room.  But other times, it seems necessary to join the room first (maybe that's onl for encrypted rooms, which seem to be the default for direct rooms in Element).

i.e. =j= for joined, =i= for invited, =l= for left, and maybe some others for archived or forgotten, depending on what the spec calls for.

[2021-08-23 Mon 19:22]  Decided that the extra column didn't look nice, and isn't that useful.  Better to just use a different face and topic message for invited rooms.

*** DONE Save room type in struct
CLOSED: [2021-08-23 Mon 19:22]

I don't see a straightforward way to know what a room's type is, other than saving it to a struct slot when processing a sync response, depending on which set of rooms it appears in.

According to the [[file:worktrees/spec/matrix-spec-r0.6.1.org::#get-_matrixclientr0sync][spec]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The state of a room that the user has been invited to. These state events may only have the =sender=, =type=, =state_key= and =content= keys present. These events do not replace any state that the client already has for the room, for example if the client has archived the room. Instead the client should keep two separate copies of the state: the one from the =invite_state= and one from the archived =state=. If the client joins the room then the current state will be given as a delta against the archived =state= not the =invite_state=.

[2022-03-22 Tue 18:00] This almost works, except that when a room is automatically created for a direct message, it is not marked as =m.direct=, so it's not detected as a direct room if the user tries to send another direct message, so a second room is automatically created.  I've tried to follow the spec in putting the direct flag in an =account_data= event, and the HTTP request seems to return 200, but it doesn't seem to have any effect, because the event that I put doesn't show up in the account data.

[2022-03-25 Fri 23:14] It works!

But I've already tried doing that, and it isn't working (the server accepts the PUT request but doesn't seem to "digest" the new event, because it's not seen in subsequent syncs).

[2022-03-25 Fri 21:27] On Thursday at 16:10 I posted this message in =#matrix-dev:matrix.org= (=$A5-ZhuaI3VBT3vmFQXXpowXZ4Rz8v_qBBeAqsPhfGHE=), but I've received no response:

#+begin_quote
Hi, having a minor problem with creating new direct messaging rooms.  The spec says that the clients are responsible for adding a new m.direct event to the account's account_data associating the invitee's ID with the new room's ID.  So that's what I'm trying to do.  The problem is that, even though the PUT request for the account_data returns 200, the new event I'm trying to PUT is not showing up in the account_data: it's not propagated in a new sync event, nor does it appear in a new initial sync, nor does it appear in the PUT request's response (which appears to include the whole m.direct account_data event).  Unfortunately, the spec does not give an example of a properly formed PUT request for an m.direct event, so I could be making a mistake there, but the server response is 200, which would suggest that I'm doing that correctly.  So I'm a bit stumped.  Any help would be appreciated.

Looking at what Element itself sends, it appears that the m.direct event it PUTs does not include only the new room, but also all of the existing content of the account's current m.direct event, with the new room added to it.  However, the spec doesn't indicate that this is necessary, so I guessed that I only need to send the new user ID and room ID, and that the server would add those to the account's existing m.direct event.  But the server doesn't appear to be doing either: it's not replacing the m.direct event with the one I'm sending, nor is it adding the content of the one I'm sending to the existing account data event.  But it is responding with HTTP 200, implying that there is no error.  So...yeah...stumped.  :)

So at this point, I've done my best to imitate Element's behavior in PUTting the m.direct account_data event, and the server seems to accept it, but the event content I send is not returned by the server on subsequent syncs.  So I don't seem to be able to mark rooms as direct message rooms.  I've even found this function in the react SDK that does the same thing: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/blob/919aab053e5b3bdb5a150fd90855ad406c19e4ab/src/Rooms.ts#L91  And I've tried doing the equivalent in my client, but it seems to have no effect on the m.direct event later returned by the server.
#+end_quote

[2022-03-25 Fri 23:14] Silly me, the problem was that I forgot to set the HTTP method to PUT on the request.

[2020-12-05 Sat 16:11]  I made a new room, =#ement.el:matrix.org=, but the room is listed in this client without a name, alias, topic, etc.  In the room buffer, I see these events:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
@alphapapa:matrix.org
[sender:@alphapapa:matrix.org type:m.room.create]
 (join)
[sender:@alphapapa:matrix.org type:m.room.power_levels]

I guess, for some reason, the server isn't sending the same initial state data, so we need to apply the room state events as they come in.  This is also necessary for when those things are changed during a session.

There seem to be two options: pass the URL on the command line, or pass it in a temp file.  Either way is bad: the command line makes it visible to all users (AFAIK), and temp files are messy, could be left behind, clutter the disk, etc.

Curl has so many options that I was hoping for a way to pass the URL via STDIN, and there is, but that appears to preclude the passing of other data via STDIN.  I found [[https://curl.se/mail/archive-2003-08/0099.html][this mailing list thread from 2003]] where Rich Gray asks for this very feature, but Daniel Stenberg shoots down the idea:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
While you of course are 100% correct, I fail to see why curl has to do all this by itself. This kind of magic will only be attempted by people who are using unix(-like) operating systems and if you sit in front of a unix box, it would be dead easy to write a wrapper script around curl that hides all the arguments quite nicely already, right?

The same goes for your idea of being able to read from specific file handle numbers.

I don't think adding these features would benefit more than a few unix hackers (most likely wearing beards! ;-O), who already know how to overcome the problems they fix.
#+END_QUOTE

In fact, writing a wrapper script does not help at all: how horribly hacky and messy it would be to /write a shell script to the disk every time I want to call curl from Emacs/.

It seems that using lazy loading causes the server to not send membership events for senders when loading earlier messages.  According to [[https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.1#id267][the spec for ~/members~]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Unless include_redundant_members is true, the server may remove membership events which would have already been sent to the client in prior calls to this endpoint, assuming the membership of those members has not changed.
#+END_QUOTE

But these are senders for whom we have not already been sent membership events, neither by ~/sync~ nor by ~/members~, so they would not be redundant, so it shouldn't be necessary to enable redundant membership events.  So I don't know if this is a bug in the spec or in the matrix.org server, or if somehow I'm missing something.

I guess it's worth a try to enable redundant membership events for ~/members~.  If that fixes it, then I guess it's a bug in the spec or the server.

I wonder how Element and other clients handle this.  It would seem like the alternative would be to manually request membership data for senders that haven't been seen before, but that would mean having to either wait for that data before inserting earlier messages into a room's buffer, or using a callback and then manually replacing all of the username headers with the proper displayname, which would be awkward, and seemingly ridiculous since the spec indicates that the membership events are supposed to be included when necessary.  (Though I can't imagine how complicated it must be to program this logic on the server side.)

[2020-12-05 Sat 02:19]  I wonder if the ~/members~ response isn't including the membership events because I'm not passing a lazy-load-members filter parameter.  Maybe it's assuming that I'm not using lazy-loading and that I already have all of the member events for the room.

[2020-12-05 Sat 16:37]  I added the default sync filter to the ~/members~ request, but it still isn't returning the membership events for senders of earlier messages.  I guess I'll try enabling the "redundant" option...  

Nope, I still don't receive membership state events for senders of earlier messages, even though I set ~include_redundant_members~ to true in both the StateFilter and the RoomEventFilter.

At this point, I don't know what to do.  I may have to ask someone about the spec...sigh...

[2020-12-05 Sat 17:12]  Found these issues that seem related, but I can't find a solution in them.

There's also this Google Doc about the spec proposal: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/11yn-mAkYll10RJpN0mkYEVqraTbU3U4eQx9MNrzqX1U/edit#heading=h.q5mz9uiufb2g][Proposal for lazy-loading room members to improve initial sync speed and client RAM usage - Google Docs]].  It says:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When returning a /sync or /messages response, the server includes a state block (similar to that seen in an initial /sync) to provide the membership info about the senders of the events in the timeline segment being synced.
#+END_QUOTE

But it doesn't seem to be doing that.

I guess I'll look for that Matrix client developer room and see if anyone in there can help...  I can't find such a room with Element.  I guess I'll try the Matrix Spec room, assuming that still exists...  That one says it's about specific proposals, so I guess I'll try the Matrix HQ room...

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Hi, I'm trying to implement lazy-loading in my client, and I've found that, when I retrieve earlier messages using /messages, the server doesn't seem to send membership state events for senders that were not in the initial sync.  I've looked up what seem to be the related issues on the repo, and I've looked at the spec proposal, and it seems to say that the server should be sending them.  I'm setting lazy_load_member to true for both the RoomEvent and State filters, and I've also tried setting include_redundant_members in both filters, and it makes no difference.  Is the server not behaving according to the spec?  Or am I missing something?  Am I supposed to manually fetch membership data for newly seen senders?
#+END_QUOTE

[2020-12-05 Sat 17:44]  Someone suggested I ask in =#matrix-dev:matrix.org=, the channel I was unable to find.

[2020-12-05 Sat 17:47]  Something weird: In the current retro callback, the state events are currently coded to push the raw alists rather than event structs (which is not the right thing to do), but after loading earlier messages, every element of the room's state list is an event struct.  That would suggest that this code isn't doing anything:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (cl-loop for event across state
           ;; FIXME: Need to use make-event
           do (push event (ement-room-state room)))
#+END_SRC

Which would suggest that the ~state~ variable is nil there, which doesn't make sense...  Sure enough, the ~state~ key in the ~/messages~ response is nil.  That doesn't make sense...

[2020-12-05 Sat 18:20]  Wow, in every response to ~/messages~, there is no ~state~ key, and I see ~m.room.member~ events in the ~chunk~!  That is not according to the spec!  ...Yes, it appears that all the membership events, including the ones with the displaynames, are in the ~chunk~!  The [[https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.1#id267][spec says]] that the ~state~ parameter includes:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
state	[RoomStateEvent]  A list of state events relevant to showing the chunk. For example, if lazy_load_members is enabled in the filter then this may contain the membership events for the senders of events in the chunk.
#+END_QUOTE

And it says that ~RoomStateEvent~ includes the parameters like ~prev_content~, which I'm seeing in the membership events in ~chunk~.  It also says that ~chunk~ is a list of ~RoomEvent~, which are /not/ listed as including ~prev_content~.  So it seems that the server is sending the membership events in the wrong parameter!  I guess this gives me a better question to ask in the dev channel...

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Hi, I've been implementing lazy-loading support in my client, and I seem to be seeing a response from the server that is not according to the [[https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.1#id267][spec]] for ~/messages~: The spec says that the ~state~ parameter is a list of ~RoomStateEvent~ objects, and the ~chunk~ parameter is a list of ~RoomEvent~ objects.  But in the response I'm getting from the server, the ~state~ parameter is not present, and the ~chunk~ parameter includes ~RoomStateEvent~ events, such as ~m.room.member~, which, e.g. have ~prev_content~ keys, which would make them ~RoomStateEvent~ objects according to the spec.  Am I missing something, or is the matrix.org server not behaving according to spec?
#+END_QUOTE

To make it all extra confusing, the example response in the spec does not have a ~state~ key, and it includes an ~m.room.name~ event in the ~chunk~!

[2020-12-05 Sat 18:41]  Well, I don't know if I'll get a response anytime soon, if ever.  So I guess, for now at least, I have to work around it by adding events that are not  ~m.room.message~ events to the state list myself.

[2020-12-05 Sat 18:54]  Well, I thought that if I did that, it would fix the problem.  But now that I've written the code for that, I'm not actually seeing those events in the chunk, so I'm still not getting the membership events when loading earlier messages.

[2020-12-05 Sat 18:57]  It appears that I wrote that code on master and forgot I had the attempted fix on ~wip/lazy-retro~.  So let's try it on the right branch...  Still not seeing any ~m.room.member~ events in the ~chunk~.  What is going on?!

[2020-12-05 Sat 19:08]  I can no longer find any non- ~m.room.message~ events in ~chunk~ in the ~/messages~ responses.  I have no explanation for any of this.

[2020-12-05 Sat 19:40]  Well, I'm about out of ideas.  I just [[https://matrix.to/#/!jxlRxnrZCsjpjDubDX:matrix.org/$2hcPB3Og6spKfEsh0yRr3_uMxrf-qpkRfZr_7ldgiUc?via=matrix.org&via=interpont.com&via=cervoi.se][posted]] this to that room:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE markdown
Well, this is very strange: I can no longer find `RoomStateEvent` events in the `chunk` parameter.  I don't know what I did to cause that.  But the ultimate problem I've been trying to solve remains: When I'm using lazy-loading, and I request `/messages`, and some of those messages are from senders that were not in the initial `/sync`, I do not receive any `RoomStateEvent` events for those senders, such as their `m.room.member` events, and, in fact, the `state` parameter in the response is always missing.  I need these membership events so I can show the senders' displaynames, and the spec says that they should be sent by the server for senders whose membership events haven't been sent to me yet.  Even when I set `include_redundant_members` to `true`, the server still doesn't send anything in `state`.  AFAICT the server is not behaving according to the spec, but I hope I'm missing something.
#+END_QUOTE

I don't know what else to do, other than to not use lazy-loading, which would be awful to go back to.  And manually requesting membership data and iterating over the messages in the buffer to fix them would be pretty awful too.

[2020-12-05 Sat 19:51]  Digging into the ~matrix-js-sdk~ tests, it looks like even [[https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/blob/04bbfae08e3e8fe9d329b2f950c4f86545a3cfea/spec/integ/matrix-client-room-timeline.spec.js#L230][their own code]] doesn't expect a ~state~ parameter, and it just uses ~chunk~.

[2020-12-05 Sat 19:55]  Oh, great, I see [[https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/blob/5993dd588c697ff8f5b9ca87616f038c886aac56/src/client.js#L4037][this comment]] in their ~/messages~ fetching code:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
  // XXX: it's horrific that /messages' filter parameter doesn't match
  // /sync's one - see https://matrix.org/jira/browse/SPEC-451
#+END_SRC

That issue is now at https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/706, which has not been closed.  The original description:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Superficially /messages and /sync both take filter params. Except /sync is a 'filter collection' (which may be either an ID or a blob of JSON, and is also known as a 'filter'), whereas /messages takes a 'filter component' as a blob of JSON (sometimes called a 'filter'). At the very least, the params should be named differently, and the whole naming convention should be untangled.
#+END_QUOTE

So I don't know if that's causing the problem.  But Matthew even [[https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/706#issuecomment-418191755][says]] (Sep 3, 2018):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
this continues to bite me constantly (esp with LL)
#+END_QUOTE

I guess if I don't get a response in the chat room, I'll file an issue.  But I don't know if it's a bug in the spec, or the server, or both.

But their own JS code (not the test spec) [[https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/blob/5993dd588c697ff8f5b9ca87616f038c886aac56/src/client.js#L4149][seems to look for a ~state~ parameter]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
        promise.then(function(res) {
            if (res.state) {
                const roomState = eventTimeline.getState(dir);
                const stateEvents = utils.map(res.state, self.getEventMapper());
                roomState.setUnknownStateEvents(stateEvents);
            }
            const token = res.end;
            const matrixEvents = utils.map(res.chunk, self.getEventMapper());
            eventTimeline.getTimelineSet()
                .addEventsToTimeline(matrixEvents, backwards, eventTimeline, token);
#+END_SRC

I wonder what ~roomState.setUnknownStateEvents~ does.

Anyway, here's what I currently understand to be the case:

+  The spec says that, when calling ~/messages~ with a lazy-loading filter, the response should include a ~state~ parameter, and it should include membership events for senders in the ~chunk~ parameter for whom membership events have not yet been sent.
+  In practice, ~/messages~ responses never have a ~state~ parameter set, and the ~chunk~ parameter does not include membership events, either (although at one point in my testing, I seemed to find some membership events in a ~chunk~, but later I couldn't reproduce that behavior).
+  The JS SDK's test spec does not appear to expect or test for a ~state~ parameter in ~/messages~ responses.
+  The JS SDK's code appears to use the ~state~ parameter when it's in the response, but it's not clear what it does with such events.
+  I don't know how the JS SDK handles getting displaynames for senders that were not in the initial sync.  Does it work around the fact that the server appears to violate the spec?  (The JS code is very complicated, and the codebase is labyrinthine, so I have little enthusiasm for digging deeper into it.)

So as best I can tell, the server is violating the spec.

[2021-07-25 Sun 14:12]  After carefully digging into the raw events, reviewing these notes, and talking with Michael (t3chguy) in =#matrix-dev:matrix.org=, I found that I was sending =/messages= the kind of filter that =/sync= expects, rather than the =RoomEventFilter= that is called for. (Actually, I wasn't sending =/messages= any filter before now, and then today I started by sending it the wrong kind.) After fixing that, finally, loading earlier messages gets the membership events for newly seen users, and the displaynames are seen!  Finally this can be put to rest.
